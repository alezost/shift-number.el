;;; Commentary:

;; Increase or decrease the number at point with `shift-number-up' and
;; `shift-number-down' commands.

;; To install the package manually, add the following to your init file:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/shift-number-dir")
;; (autoload 'shift-number-up "shift-number" nil t)
;; (autoload 'shift-number-down "shift-number" nil t)

;; For more verbose description and a gif demonstration, see
